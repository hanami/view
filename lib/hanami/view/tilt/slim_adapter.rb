        # use(:Generator) { options[:generator] }

        # Because this Temple filter is set as a proc, the resulting effect within Temple's EngineDSL

        # on Slim::Engine itself. This means we receive a "Option :capture_generator is invalid"
        # warning when we set our `capture_generator:` below.
        #
        # However, this option is perfectly valid, so here we merge all the options for Slim's default
        # generator into the top-level engine's options, avoiding the warning.
